# 👜 Vamp Bags | Product Landing Page

## 📖 Overview

This project is part of my FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification.
The objective was to build a Product Landing Page using only HTML and CSS. To demonstrate HTML/CSS layout, responsive design, and form handling.

I chose to create "Vamp Bags", a fictional gothic/fantasy-inspired brand, because I enjoy dark aesthetics and wanted to give the page a unique personal style.

The page showcases a product lineup, features section, embedded video, responsive layout, and working email signup form that fulfills all the required user stories.

## ✨ Features

- Fixed top navigation bar that remains visible while scrolling.
- Logo and navigation links inside the header.
- Email sign-up form with HTML5 email validation.
- Product showcase with Features, Video, and Pricing sections.

- Responsive layout with CSS Flexbox and a media query.
- Styled buttons, hover effects, and consistent gothic/fantasy design theme.
