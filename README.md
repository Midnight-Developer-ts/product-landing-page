# 👜 Vamp Bags | Product Landing Page

## 📖 Overview
This product landing page was created as part of my Responsive Web Design certification through FreeCodeCamp. The objective of the project was to build a responsive product layout with form handling using only HTML and CSS. I chose to create Vamp Bags, a fictional gothic, fantasy inspired brand, to explore dark aesthetics and give the project a unique personal style.

The page features a demo product lineup, a features section, an embedded video, responsive navigation, and an email signup form used for demonstation purposes. While the email form and footer links are not connected to a backend, they simulate real world functionality and layout behavior within a front-end only project.


## ✨ Features
- Fixed top navigation bar that remains visible while scrolling.
- Logo and navigation links inside the header.
- Email sign-up form with HTML5 email validation.
- Product showcase with Features, Video, and Pricing sections.
- Embedded YouTube video in “How It Works.”
- Responsive layout with CSS Flexbox and a media query.
- Styled buttons, hover effects, and consistent gothic/fantasy design theme.
- Footer with developer credit and external link.
